   mvn clean install
   cd services/property-service
   mvn spring-boot:run
   cd services/investment-service
   mvn spring-boot:run
   cd services/wallet-service
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

3. **Access H2 Console**:

   - Use the following credentials:

     - **Driver Class**: `org.h2.Driver`
     - **JDBC URL**: `jdbc:h2:mem:propertydb`
     - **User Name**: `sa`
     - **Password**: (leave empty).
